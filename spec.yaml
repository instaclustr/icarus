        duration:
          type: string
          description: |
            Based on this field, there will be throughtput per second computed based on what size data we want to upload we have. The formula is "size / duration". The lower the duration is, the higher throughput per second we will need and vice versa. This will influence e.g. responsiveness of a node to its business requests so one can control how much bandwidth is used for backup purposes in case a cluster is fully operational. The format of this field is "amount unit". 'unit' is just a (case-insensitive) java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit enum value. If not used, there will not be any restrictions as how fast an upload can be.
          example: |
            1 hour

        snapshotTag:
          type: string
          description: |
            name of snapshot to make so this snapshot will be uploaded to storage location. If not specified, the name of snapshot will be automatically generated and it will have name 'autosnap-milliseconds-since-epoch'. There is a schema version automatically appended to this string, as well as a timestamp what that snapshot was taken. Both information are necessary in order to be able to distinguish between two backups with same name done against same schema version - but they are done at different time. The end user does not have to specify schema nor timestamp, it will be resovled automatically.
          example: mySnapshot

If schema version is not specified, we expect that there will be one and only one backup taken with respective snapshot name.

        restarts a Cassandra node this Sidecar talks to. This operation will be successfully carried out only in case both Cassandra node as well as this Sidecar are running in Kubernetes. There is an assumption that Cassandra node and Sidecar are running in separate Docker containers as part of the same Kubernetes Pod. The restart is done by executing "/bin/kill 1" of Cassandra container where pid 1 stands for Cassandra process. The logic behind restart is that Kubernetes detects that container has finished and it will start it again on its own. Before Cassandra node is stopped, it is drained first so there are not any requests comming to this node whatsover hence restart is safe.
