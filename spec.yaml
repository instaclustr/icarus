          description: |
            unique identifier of an operation, a random id is assigned to each operation after a request is submitted, from caller's perspective, an id is sent back as a response to his request so he can further query state of that operation, referencing id, by operations/{id} endpoint
        state:
          type: string
          description: |
            state of an operation, operation might be in various states, PENDING - this operation is pending for being submitted. RUNNING - this operation is actively doing its job, COMPLETED - this operation has finished successfully, CANCELLED - this operation was interrupted while being run, FAILED - this operation has finished errorneously

          description: |
            timestamp telling when this operation was started by Sidecar, if an operation is created, it does not necessarily mean that it will be started right away, in most cases it is the case but if e.g. ExecutorService is full on its working thread, an execution of an operation is postponed and start time is updated only after that

      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          description: |
            type of operation, one has to set it to 'backup' in case he wants this request to be considered as a backup one
        storageLocation:
          type: string
          description: |
            location where SSTables will be uploaded. A value of the storageLocation property has to have exact format which is 'protocol://bucket/clusterName/dcName/nodeName'. protocol is either 'gcp', 's3', 'azure', 'oracle' or 'file:/'. For global requests, clusterName, dcName and nodeName do not need to be specified, so location would look like 's3://my-bucket'.
          example: |
            gcp://myBucket/dev-cluster/dc1/node1
        cassandraDirectory:
          type: string
          description: |
            directory of Cassandra, by default it is /var/lib/cassandra, in this path, one expects there is 'data' directory
          example: /var/lib/cassandra
        duration:
          type: string
          description: |
            Based on this field, there will be throughtput per second computed based on what size data we want to upload we have. The formula is "size / duration". The lower the duration is, the higher throughput per second we will need and vice versa. This will influence e.g. responsiveness of a node to its business requests so one can control how much bandwidth is used for backup purposes in case a cluster is fully operational. The format of this field is "amount unit". 'unit' is just a (case-insensitive) java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit enum value. If not used, there will not be any restrictions as how fast an upload can be.
          example: |
            1 hour
        bandwidth:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataRate'
        concurrentConnections:
          type: integer
          description: |
            number of threads used for upload, there might be at most so many uploading threads at any given time, when not set, it defaults to 10

There is an assumption that Cassandra node and Sidecar are running in separate Docker containers as part of the same Kubernetes Pod. The restart is done by executing "/bin/kill 1" of Cassandra container where pid 1 stands for Cassandra process. The logic behind restart is that Kubernetes detects that container has finished and it will start it again on its own. Before Cassandra node is stopped, it is drained first so there are not any requests comming to this node whatsover hence restart is safe.
